### Please Read before Redistrubiting / Recreating
This and all scripts created in the rex repo's will always be GNU Open-source complient, hopefully this will lead to bigger and better projects and help coders in the future learn coding for FiveM and QBCore, I'll admitt my scripts likely aren't the best and use collaborations of other peoples work aka the beauty of Open Source. I ask that you do not redistribute my code as your own and if you remake it with your own optmizations and tweaks that you don't sell the product. My projects are Free as in Freedom, not free as in beer. If you are to sell the code, please consider selling your support for the code and not the code itself. Thank you for choosing my code.
